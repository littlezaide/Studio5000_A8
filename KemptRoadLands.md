# executive summary



# introduction

Halifax's recently updated 25 year plan, RP+5, recommends focusing 25% of residential growth in the municipality to the Regional Centre [@RP+5]. The Regional Centre refers to about 33km^2^ of land area including the downtown of both Halifax and Dartmouth, as well as all of the Halifax Peninsula and Dartmouth within the Circumferential Highway. 

Within that Regional Centre, there are several brown- and greenfield opportunity-sites which could be redeveloped as residential land at some point, in order to provide enough capacity to reach those goals. The site I will examine is a 50ha commercial/industrial area in the northwestern corner of the peninsula, bounded by Young, Robie and Windsor Streets, Massachusetts Avenue, and Lady Hammond Road. For the purposes of this report, we will refer to the study area as the *Kempt Road Lands* though it has been known by other names historically, including Willow Park (whose name persists in the name of the Canadian Forces Base on the site). Our study area is approximately 50 hectares, about 1.5% of the Regional Centre by area.

This paper will look at the Kempt Road Lands as an area of opportunity for the city in three ways, by examining: 

1. a brief history of the site, in as much as it informs its current state
2. the current context (policy and use)
3. problems of development

# history

In 1878 our study area is covered in farmland. Hopkins' City Atlas of Halifax from 1878 shows several large farm parcels. The only buildings were farmhouses, stables and outbuildings, as well as two slaughterhouses [@HopkinsAtlas, p24]. The street layout was similar to the way it is now, with the Massachusetts Avenue freeway notably absent. A stream ran down the hill from where Windsor St. and Kempt Rd. approach each other; it ran alongside Kempt Road and emptied out into Stanford Pond adjacent to Fairview Cove [@FaribaultHalifax1908]. Stanford Pond no longer exists; it was where the Fairview Cemetery and CN Fairview rail yards are today. In 1878, no rail lines, commercial facilities or factories existed in the area.

The area began to change significantly in the 1880s as a result of industrialization, as with many other areas of the city. In 1882, the City of Halifax enabled industrial development in the area by subsidizing a spur[^a spur is a generally short section of railway which connects an industrial client with a main or branch line] from the Intercolonial rail yards in Richmond (where the Irving Shipyards are today) into our study area in order to service a new cotton factory: the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company [@Assembly1883, p75]. The Intercolonial railway of the age connected Halifax with Montréal and other points east of Halifax, and is now a small part of the massive CN Rail network in North America. In the late 19th century, connecting a factory with a railway to larger population centres was necessary to the success of an institution. The cotton factory was one of the largest industrial facilities in Halifax at the time [source?]. The Nova Scotian ownership of the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company persisted only into 1891, being bought up by the Dominion Cotton Mills of Montréal, and incorporated into a growing network of cotton mills across eastern Canada [@LACHalifaxInd]. 

The cotton mill lies just southeast of our study area, but is significant because it was the catalyst for industrial development in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Building the railway tracks into the area enabled many factories and commercial facilities to thrive there by allowing raw goods to come into the area to be processed, and completed, manufactured goods to be distributed to points-of-sale elsewhere in the Dominion. The Kempt Road Lands are, in essence, Halifax's first business park not tied to the harbour, realizing the economies of scale in bringing together various factories around transportation public works. 

The area to the west of the Cotton Factory spur became a large rail yard for the Intercolonial railway in 1909, after a fire at the Richmond rail yard's coal shed convinced authorities that the Richmond facility was becoming overloaded. [source?]

East of Young Street (and also just outside our study area) was the Nova Scotia Exhibition grounds. These grounds contained several large scale entertainment and commercial facilities, including a horse-racing track, a large exhibition building, as well as the Halifax Forum (the only building of the exhibition grounds which remains today). All were served by the Cotton Factory rail spur. In 1957, the Stephenson redevelopment report for Halifax recommended the redevelopment of the exhibition grounds into housing: "[the Exhibition Grounds] includes some land for industrial buildings, and some for a major sports centre adjacent to the existing grandstand. The geographical location is excellent for a sports centre. Being in an industrial area, traffic and parking would not create a disturbance." [@Stephenson1957, p67] Despite the recommendation, the block was left as a super-block, currently home to the Canada Post Central Office, the Mayflower Curling Rink, a large office building and a strip mall. 

On the west side of Kempt Road, the land persisted largely as farmland and market gardens into the 1920s [@Morton1990, p56].

In 1917 a French ship, the Mont-Blanc, containing 3000 tonnes of raw explosives exploded in Halifax Harbour adjacent to the Richmond neighbourhood destroying a vast area of northern Halifax, including the Halifax Exhibition building, and much of the cotton mill.

# policy context

## the regional plan

The Regional Municipality Planning Strategy (aka RP+5), the overarching regional plan for Halifax, makes no specific mention of the Kempt Road Lands, except to briefly mention the necessity of realigning the Kempt Road/Windsor Street intersection to improve traffic flow [@RP+5]. Most of the Halifax Peninsula, including all of the Kempt Road Lands, is designated in RP+5 as "urban settlement" which means that it already is serviced by municipal water and wastewater [@RP+5]. 

## the Halifax Peninsula MPS

The entire area sits within the Halifax Peninsula bylaw area, and land uses therein are controlled by the *Halifax Peninsula Municipal Planning Strategy* (MPS) and *Land Use Bylaws* (LUB) [@HalifaxPeninsulaMPS2014]. Within the Halifax Peninsula MPS, the Kempt Road Lands is designated for future use mostly as industrial land, with pockets of residential, institutional and commercial land [@HalifaxPeninsulaMPS2014]. There are no height or view-plane restrictions, and the lands are not covered by any secondary planning strategy below the MPS. 

## zoning 

Within the Halifax Peninsula MPS, several zones outline what is possible within the Kempt Road Lands. Currently it contains three groups of zones, commercial (primarily C-2 and C-3), residential (R-2 and R-3) and park and institutional (P). The single **P** zone in our study area contains Department of National Defence's *Willow Park*. The area bounded by Windsor, Strawberry Hill and Hood Street is a designated "soft area" where special planning has been applied, though no further information is available [@HalifaxPeninsulaMPS2014].

## residential zones

[residential density map]

The residential density is very low with 442 people/km^2^ for the whole area. As is clear from the density map above, the majority of residents live in a small cluster of 5 residential zones (R-2 and R-3) near Windsor Street at the intersection with Strawberry Hill, representing about 4% of the study area. ![image of apartment buildings](assets/site-visit2/IMG_4917.JPG) Most of the buildings are multi-unit and abut the high side of a cliff which separates the residential from the industrial/commercial zones of the area. The cliff is 8-10m high. The residences are paired with several zones of single family homes just outside the study area, south of Windsor Street. Taken as a unit, the residential area in question is an island surrounded by industrial and large institutional zones on all sides: Canadian Forces Base Halifax's Willow and Windsor Parks, the Fairview Cemetery, and the Kempt Road industrial lands to the north. 

The population within the Kempt Road Lands is 221 people, living in 159 residential units [@StatisticsCanadaGAF2011]. The average people per housing unit is 1.39.
