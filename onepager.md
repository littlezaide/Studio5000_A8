## Proposal

The lands bounded by Kempt Road, Massachussetts Avenue, Lady Hammond Road and Windsor Street in Halifax have seen over 130 years of industrial and commercial use. The area is, in a way, Halifax's first industrial park, started when the Nova Scotia Cotton Factory was founded in 1882. Halifax subsidized a rail spur to connect the large factory with the Intercolonial railway. Eventually, other factories established themselves in what was then wide swaths of greenfield land, not far from a rapidly industrializing city.

132 years later, the Cotton Factory Lands are no longer an active industrial site, but the land is pock-marked with former rail beds, remnants of foundations, and an unknown amount of contaminated soil. Car dealerships occupy most of what remains, along with car rental establishments and a few light industrial holdouts. The Department of National Defence (DND) is a major landholder in the area, whose Willow Park (part of CFB Halifax) takes up much of the southeastern quarter. The northeastern part of the site was heavily contaminated from its use as a rail yard, coal storage facility and steel recycling yard, and went through a major soil remediation process in the 1980s; the brownfield restoration was successful, but approvals took 10 years and produced only big box stores and strip malls. The area as it stands today provides very poor connectivity; large lots and a highway (Massachussetts Ave) essentially segregate the north end from the west end.

I will look at how the 50ha site has been used throughout its history and detail its current use. From there, I will provide an overview of the existing problems of the site, and outline the problems with redeveloping it for some higher use in the future. 

Methods of study will include a survey of historical maps and photographs (especially aerials) to establish how things have changed pre-1880s to today. Digital maps are readily availabe online, and the NS Archives, Halifax Archives and Library and Archives Canada carry many maps of Halifax going back to the city's founding in 1750. I intend to do a site visit to take photographs of and enumerate some of the current land uses. Using GIS and census data, I will be able to demonstrate some of the challenges of the Cotton Factory Lands geographically. I will inteview Luc Ouellet, senior planner for Halifax, about the city's intentions towards the area, challenges the city is aware of, and how the lands in question may be important to meeting goals set out in RP+5. Existing literature on repurposing brownfield sites may be useful in showing similar cases from other cities. 

Upon completion, this project will provide a history of the site and a set of existing problems - a useful basis on which to plan or design this area in the future.
