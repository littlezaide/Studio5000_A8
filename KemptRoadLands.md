# executive summary



# introduction

Halifax's recently updated 25 year plan, RP+5, recommends focusing 25% of residential growth in the municipality to the Regional Centre. The Regional Centre refers to about 33km^2^ of land area including Halifax and Dartmouth downtowns, as well as all of the Halifax Peninsula and Dartmouth within the Circumferential Highway. 

Within that Regional Centre, there are several brown- and greenfield opportunity-sites which could be redeveloped as residential at some point in order to provide enough capacity to reach those goals --- one is a 50ha commercial/industrial area in the northwest corner of the peninsula, bounded by Young, Robie and Windsor Streets, Massachusetts Avenue, and Lady Hammond Road.

# history

In 1878 our study area is covered in farmland. Hopkins' City Atlas of Halifax from 1878 shows several large farm parcels, with  the only buildings being farmhouses, stables and outbuildings, as well as two slaughterhouses [@HopkinsAtlas, p24]. The street layout is similar to the way it is today, with the Massachusetts Avenue freeway notably absent. A stream runs down the hill from where Windsor St. and Kempt Rd. approach each other, running alongside Kempt Road and emptying out into Stanford Pond adjacent to Fairview Cove [@FaribaultHalifax1908]. Stanford Pond no longer exists; it was where the Fairview Cemetery and CN Fairview rail yards are today. In 1878, no rail lines, commercial facilities or factories exist in the area.

The area begins to change significantly in the 1880 as a result of industrialization, as do many other areas of Halifax. In 1882, the City of Halifax enabled industrial development in the area by subsidizing a rail spur from the Intercolonial yards in Richmond (where the Irving Shipyards are today) into our study area in order to service a new cotton factory, the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company [@Assembly1883, p75]. The Intercolonial railway of the age connected Halifax with Montréal and other points east of Halifax, and is now part of the CN Rail network. In the 1880s, connecting a factory with a railway to larger population centres was necessary to the success of an institution. The cotton factory was one of the largest industrial facilities in Halifax at the time. The Nova Scotian ownership of the Nova Scotia Cotton Manufacturing Company persisted only into 1891, being bought up by the Dominion Cotton Mills of Montréal, and incorporated into a growing network of cotton mills across eastern Canada [@LACHalifaxInd]. 

The cotton mill lies just outside our study area, but is significant because it was the catalyst for development in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Building the railway tracks into the area enabled many factories and commercial facilities to thrive there by allowing raw goods to come into the area to be processed, and completed, manufactured goods to be distributed to points-of-sale elsewhere in the Dominion. 

The area to the west of the Cotton Factory spur became a large rail yard for the Intercolonial railway in 1909, after a fire at the Richmond rail yard's coal shed convinced authorities that the Richmond facility was becoming overloaded. 

South of Young Street, the Nova Scotia Exhibition grounds contained several large scale entertainment and commercial facilities, including a horse-racing track, a large exhibition building, as well as the Halifax Forum skating rink (which is the only building of the exhibition grounds which remains at this time). All were served by the rail spur. The Stephenson redevelopment report for Halifax recommended the redevelopment of the exhibition grounds into housing in 1957: "[the Exhibition Grounds] includes some land for industrial buildings, and some for a major sports centre adjacent to the existing grandstand. The geographical location is excellent for a sports centre. Being in an industrial area, traffic and parking would not create a disturbance." [@Stephenson1957, p67]

On the west side of Kempt Road, the land persisted largely as farmland and market gardens into the 1920s [@Morton1990, p56].

In 1917 a French ship, the Mont-Blanc, containing 3000 tonnes of raw explosives exploded in Halifax Harbour adjacent to the Richmond neighbourhood destroying a vast area of northern Halifax, including the Halifax Exhibition building, and much of the cotton mill.
