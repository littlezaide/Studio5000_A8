challenges of planning the next 25 years of the Cotton Factory Lands in Halifax

## Proposal

The lands bounded by Kempt Road, Massachussetts Avenue, Lady Hammond Road and Windsor Street in Halifax have seen over 130 years of industrial and commercial use. The area is, in a way, Halifax's first industrial park, started when the Nova Scotia Cotton Factory was founded in 1882. A rail spur was subsidized by the city to connect the large factory with the Intercolonial railway, encouraging other factories to establish themselves in what was then wide swaths of greenfield land.

100 years later, it is no longer an industrial site, but the land is marked with former rail beds, remnants of foundations, and an unknown amount of contaminated soil. Car dealerships occupy most of the site, along with car rental establishments and a few light industrial holdouts. The southeastern part of the site was heavily contaminated from its use as a rail yard and steel recycler, and went through a major remediation process in the 1980s; the brownfield restoration was successful, but took 10 years and produced only big box stores and strip malls. 

I will look at how the 50 hectare site has been used throughout its history as well as detail its current use. From there I will provide an overview of the existing problems of the site, and outline the problems with redeveloping it for some higher use in the future. 

Methods of study will include a survey of historical maps and photographs (especially aerials) to establish how things have changed pre-1880s to today. Both are available online, and at the NS Archives and at the Halifax Archives. Library and Archives Canada also has available several useful digital maps of Halifax. I intend to do a site visit to take photographs of and enumerate some of the current land uses. Using GIS and census data, I will be able to demonstrate some of the challenges of the Cotton Factory Lands visually. I will inteview Luc Ouellet, senior planner for Halifax, about the city's intentions towards the area, challenges the city is aware of, and how the lands in question may be important to meeting goals set out in RP+5. Existing literature on repurposing brownfield sites may be useful in providing an overview. 

The project will provide a history of the site and a set of existing problems --- a useful basis for planning and design projects which may be done in the future.
