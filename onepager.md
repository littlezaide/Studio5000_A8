challenges of planning the next 25 years of the Cotton Factory Lands in Halifax

## Proposal

The lands bounded by Kempt Road, Massachussetts Avenue, Lady Hammond Road and Windsor Street in Halifax have seen over 100 years of industrial and commercial use. The area is, in a way, Halifax's first industrial park, started when the Nova Scotia Cotton Factory was founded in 1882. Rail lines were subsidized by the city to service the large factory, spurring various other factories to establish themselves in what was then greenfield.

100 years later, it is no longer an industrial site, but the land is marked with former rail beds, remnants of foundations, and warehouses.
