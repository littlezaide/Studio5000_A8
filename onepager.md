challenges of planning the next 25 years of the Cotton Factory Lands in Halifax

## Proposal

The lands bounded by Kempt Road, Massachussetts Avenue, Lady Hammond Road and Windsor Street in Halifax have seen over 100 years of industrial and commercial use. The area is, in a way, Halifax's first industrial park, started when the Nova Scotia Cotton Factory was founded in 1882. A rail spur was subsidized by the city to connect the large factory with the Intercolonial railway, encouraging other factories to establish themselves in what was then wide swaths of greenfield land.

100 years later, it is no longer an industrial site, but the land is marked with former rail beds, remnants of foundations, and an unknown amount of contaminated soil. Car dealerships occupy most of the site, along with car rental establishments and a few light industrial holdouts. The southeastern part of the site was heavily contaminated from its use as a rail yard and steel recycler, and went through a major remediation process in the 1980s
